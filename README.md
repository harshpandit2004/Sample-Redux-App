# Introduction

Redux is a state management library used in react js to effectively use the "state" hook functionality in react.

it has 3 primary components to work with:\
Selectors : used to retrive data from the store\
Reducers : actions which can be performed on that data\
Dispatchers : used to implement the reducers to manipulate the data in the selectors. (you 'dispatch' the action to manipulate the data)

redux has a centralised place called the store (store.js) where the mutable variables or pointers to all the mutable variables exist.\
the redux library helps by providing methods which help in the manipulation on the data

# Getting Started with redux (implementation)

following steps are laid out clearly here: https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start

(its just notes for myself)\
firstly create a file called store.js in the specified path (./src/app/store.js)\
here initialise the store by the { configureStore } module found in "@reduxjs/toolkit" (import)\
initialise the store with the following snippet : \
export default configureStore({\
    reducer: {}\
});\

then in the index.js, import the following modules \
import store from "./app/store";\
import { Provider } from "react-redux";\
then wrap your app module like this:\
<Provider store={store}>\
  <App />\
</Provider>\



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
